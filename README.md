This hackweek project is a Unity3D app, ideally available for Android, IOS and HTML5.

The idea is to welcome new joiners inviting them to play this game. The game will have questions about SUSE, the new joiners will need to ask other SUSE employees for the correct answer, so they will socialize and learn SUSE culture at same time.
When they win the game and e-mail will be sent to a concrete address (it might be someone from facilities) and they will receive and small gift as Welcome Pack. For instanll the small chameleon or a t-shirt.
